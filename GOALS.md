# Project Goals

Our goal is creating a **hardened Kali Linux press containing a self-learning IDS**. All development efforts should align with this objective.

- Automate the installation and configuration of Kali Linux with strong security defaults.
- Train and run a neural network-based IDS leveraging legal datasets.
- Provide optional host-hardening tools for Windows environments.
- Keep documentation and scripts modular for easy customization.
